# The Dual Challenge {background-image="images/borneo.png" background-opacity="0.7"}

::: notes
Objective:

-   Present an overview of the problem of financing development and climate action...

-   ... how innovative finance helps mobilize additional funds for these objectives, and

-   some of its limitations.

Two disclaimers:

-   I speak in my own name.

-   I am a practitioner.

## Financing the SDGs requires finding new sources of finance

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
-   SDGs provide the roadmap to ending poverty

-   Require \$5.6---6.4 trillion *per year* to 2030

-   AAAA provides to roadmap to financing the SDGs, from all sources

-   Hence, the **Financing for Development** agenda proposes to go ***from billions to trillions***

    -   ODA: \~\$200 ***billion*** (2022)

    -   Global gross private sector financial assets: \~\$300 ***trillion***

-   While private finance mobilization holds promises, **it works mostly for revenue-generating activites**

::: notes
-   In 2000, the world adopted Millenium Development Goals for 2015.

    -   Only 8, with 21 targets: made it easier to focus.
    -   Limited to developing countries.

-   In 2016, The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted.

    -   17 SDGs: Gender equality, no one left behind, tackling climate crisis, partnerships

    -   169 targets, applicable to all countries.

-   As of 2023, only \~15% of SDG targets are on track.

-   AAAA is the roadmap to financing the SDGs. Financing from **all sources**.

    -   Domestic resources mobilization (taxes)
    -   Domestic and international private capital
    -   International development cooperation
    -   Debt
    -   Trade as an engine for development
    -   Science and technology capacity building

-   MDBs and other DFIs have a key role in aligning private finance incentives to SDGs

-   **However: Financial markets can only fund activities generating returns**

-   Debt crisis: 3.3 bn people live in countries spending more on debt servicing than on education and health

-   Regarding the sovereign debt: important to note that only about 20% of developing countries' public debt is with OECD countries (Paris Club). Private creditors and Chinese export banks own the balance.

## Climate change threatens to derail development efforts

-   Limiting global average temperature to 1.5°C requires a **45% reduction in CO~2~ emissions by 2030** (IPCC 2023). [**(off track)**]{.smallcaps}.

-   At US\$803 billion (2020), **global climate finance flows represent only 35% of overall needs** of developing countries.

-   Developed countries have also **committed to raising \$US 100 B a year** in climate finance for developing countries by 2020. **([off track]{.smallcaps})**.

-   Objective is to create opportunities to **unlock trillions of dollars** and shift investment to climate action *at scale*.

::: notes
-   The **Paris Agreement is a legally binding** international **treaty** on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP21 in 2015 in Paris.

-   Its overarching goal is to hold "the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels" and pursue efforts "to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels."

-   To achieve this, GHG emissions must peak before 2025 at the latest and decline 43% by 2030.

-   This is off-track.

-   Last year at COP27, the decision made was to request the parties to the treaty to increase their 2030 targets to align with the goal.

-   For example, Canada's new target is to reduce GHG emissions by 40-45% below 2005 by 2030. (Previous target: 30%)

-   CC **Mitigation** is mostly funded with ***loans*** / **Adaptation** with ***grants***.

-   At US\$803 billion (2020), global climate finance flows are only 35% of overall needs of developing countries. Small given that:

    -   Mitigating GHG emissions = investment opportunities

    -   Adapting to climate change = reducing long-term costs

## Multilateral funds are at the centre of OECD countries' climate finance objectives

![](images/OECD%20(2022)%20Climate%20finance%20provided%20and%20mobilised%20in%202013-2020%20(USD%20billion).png){fig-align="center" width="1264"}

::: notes
-   In 2020, **OECD countries mobilized 83 Bn in climate finance** ⇒ Mix of bilateral public funds (31 B), multilateral funds (31 B), mobilized private capital (13 B).

-   43% of climate finance flows to developing countries are provided through multilateral funds.

-   A substantial part of climate finance is delivered as loans, principally for GHG mitigation, including:

    -   Renewable energy generation

    -   Energy efficiency

    -   Electric transportation

-   Because t**hese are fundamentally market activities,** it opens the possibility to mobilize finance from private markets.

    -   In 2020, this provided 15% of total climate finance flows.

-   Conversely, most adaptation finance is provided as grants, because the are often associated with public goods investments---often to manage water. For example:

    -   Watershed management (floods, droughts)

    -   Irrigation

    -   Research on drought-resistant crops

    -   Sea walls

# Innovative Finance {background-image="images/borneo.png" background-opacity="0.7"}

## Most of the population now lives in Middle Income Countries

![](images/WDI_pop_in_countries_by_income_group.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
This is critical. It means that we can considerably diversify the sources of finance:

-   Developing country governments' own resources, present and future ⇒ It might be possible to increase their access to cheap finance for adaptation or poverty reduction and growth

    -   Example of the International Facility for Financing Education later

-   Internal private markets, including institutional investors ⇒ Blended finance

-   National private markets ⇒ Blended finance

## What is innovative finance?

> "Financial structures and mechanisms that **mobilize, govern or distribute** funds beyond traditional donor-country ODA."

(Canada, [*A Canadian Approach to Innovative Financing for Sustainable Development*](https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/issues_development-enjeux_developpement/priorities-priorites/fiap_fsd-paif_fdd.aspx?lang=eng)).

| Financial                              | Non-Financial               |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Concessional Loans                     | Technical Assistance        |
| Guarantees                             | Challenge Prizes            |
| Equity                                 | Advanced Market Commitments |
| Results-Based Financing                |                             |
| Impact Bonds (e.g. Blue / Greed Bonds) |                             |

## Blended finance is one approach to innovative finance

> Blended finance is a **structuring approach** that allows **organizations with different objectives** to invest alongside each other while achieving their own objectives (whether financial return, social impact, or a blend of both).
>
> The main investment barriers for private investors addressed by blended finance are **(1) high perceived and real risk** and **(2) poor returns for the risk** relative to comparable investments.

Source: Convergence (2023), [*Blended Finance*](https://www.convergence.finance/blended-finance)

::: notes
Blended finance transactions should have three signature characteristics:

-   The transaction **contributes towards achieving the SDGs**. However, not every participant needs to have that development objective. Private investors in a blended finance structure may simply be seeking a market-rate financial return.

-   Overall, **the transaction expects to yield a positive financial return**. Different investors in a blended finance structure will have different return expectations, ranging from concessional to market-rate.

-   **The public and/or philanthropic parties are catalytic.** The participation from these parties improves the risk/return profile of the transaction in order to attract participation from the private sector.
:::

## How to ensure that blended finance remains focused on development objectives?

The OECD DAC has adopted **five principles** to guide the development of blended finance transactions.

1.  Anchor blended finance use to a development rationale

2.  Design blended finance to increase the mobilization of commercial finance

3.  Tailor blended finance to local context

4.  Focus on effective partnering for blended finance

5.  Monitor blended finance for transparency and results

::: notes
1.  The use of public funds in BF transactions must seek to further SDGs.
2.  **Additionality**: public funds are used only when commercial finance would not go on its own. / **Minimal concessionality:** subsidizing the private sector the least possible. / Aim for **commercial sustainability**.
3.  Contribute to local financial markets development
4.  Aim for scalability
5.  Ensure that **resources** are devoted to **tracking development results**, **commercial performance, mobilization**.

## A typical blended finance fund structure

![](images/blended_finance.png){fig-align="center" width="1334"}

::: notes
-   Blended finance funds tend to invest over 10-25 years ⇒ Require **patient capital**.
-   Equity in the fund provides this patience.
-   Fund can be a debt fund or an equity fund: depends on what it provides to SMEs or MFIs, not how it is constituted.
-   Junior shares typically:
    -   receive far less returns
    -   absorb all losses
    -   is paid back at the end... if any remains.
-   TAF provides know-how. Reduces risks for investors, by making SMEs more profitable.
-   Example BlueOrchard's LAC Gender, Diversity, and Inclusion Fund.
    -   Provides finance to MFIs seeking to further the financial inclusion of women, Indigenous, and Afro-Descendents in LAC region.
    -   TAF helps MFIs develop financial products that take into account the financial realities of women
    -   GAC provided \$50 m in blended finance, mostly in junior position.
    -   Also \$5 m for the TAF.
    -   IDB Invest, a DFI, purchased mezzanine shares

## How to multiply each dollar by 25: the International Finance Facility for Education (IFFEd)

![](images/diagramme_IFFEd.png){width="1334"}

::: notes
-   The premise of IFFEd is that LMICs can afford to borrow for education, but not at commercial rates.
-   Under the traditional model, \$140 million in grant will provide \$140 million in goods and services to developing countries.
-   Under the IFFEd model, the same amount (in guarantee and grants) will provide \$1 billion in concessional loans.
-   IFFEd aims to unlock \$10 billion for education over 5 years.
-   Cannot work with highly indebted countries or LICs.
:::

## Innovative finance suffers from limitations

-   Innovative finance can multiply impact when the conditions are right, BUT:

    -   reflows require credit-worthy borrowers---whether individuals, companies, or states;
    -   effective when working with market mechanisms---less appropriate for public goods (e.g. education, climate change adaptation) and transfer payments (social safety net).

-   It is complex to set up:

    -   the balance between compensating risk and subsidization is difficult to assess

    -   due diligence on financial structure is complex

    -   multiple layers of financing → impact is difficult to monitor and attribute

::: notes
-   Difficult to implement in LICs due to market constraints:
    -   Risk is too high for most investors
    -   Returns are often too low when factoring in currency risk
-   Climate change *mitigation* works well. Climate change *adaptation* is more complex to implement using a repayable instrument (loan, equity).
-   (Note: Public goods can be funded by a sovereign or sub-sovereign entity using concessional loans or bonds sourced from private markets.)
:::

# In summary

## Key messages

-   The face of poverty is changing, but there remains 700 m people living in absolute poverty---or 4 billion when considering also urban poor in LMICs (\< US\$3.65/day) and UMICs (\< US\$ 6.65/day).

-   Reaching the SDGs will be extremely expensive. This is compounded by the cost of adapting to climate change and of mitigating GHG emissions.

-   Innovative finance is an important tool for financing development and climate action. It aims to put private markets in the service of development.

-   However, it suffers from limitations: only works when returns are expected.

-   It is complex to set up: each transaction is unique, and it is difficult to find the appropriate level of subsidization.

-   Despite its appeal, it has not yet succeeded in bringing development finance to scale.
